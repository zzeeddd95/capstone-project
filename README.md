Predicting stock price movement via machine learning and sentiment analysis.

The ability to predict how the stock market will perform on a given day is one of the most difficult tasks to achieve. 
There are countless factors that can influence the price of a stock, all ranging from global pandemics, to tweets made by eccentric CEOâ€™s. 
All these aspects combine to make share prices extremely volatile and exceedingly difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.
The strength of the American economy can be judged via stock market indices such as the NASDAQ, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones. 
Each of these indices are made up of several high-level and low-level companies that help drive the value of the index either up or down, thus providing an insight into how the economy is doing
With that being said, the goal of this project is to determine future stock prices for Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet, the biggest companies trading on the NASDAQ index,
as well as future prices for the NASDAQ itself in its entirety, and compare the results to identify how much power those four companies have over the index, and whether or not an uptrend in those companies would also lead to an uptrend in the NASDAQ.
